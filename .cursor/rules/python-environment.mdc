# Python Environment

This project uses a virtual environment located at `venv/` in the project root.

## Required: Always Use venv

When running any Python code, tests, or scripts, you **MUST** use the virtual environment:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the venv Python directly
./venv/bin/python script.py
./venv/bin/pip install package

# Option 2: Activate first (for multiple commands)
source venv/bin/activate
python script.py
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/

# Build Cython extensions
./venv/bin/python setup.py build_ext --inplace

# Install dependencies
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Do NOT use bare `python` or `pip` commands without the venv prefix.
