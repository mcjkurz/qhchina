This study uses artificial intelligence to uncover a geometric structure underlying parallelism in classical Chinese poetry, offering a new perspective beyond traditional symbolic interpretations. To automatically detect parallelism in poetic verse, the authors train a BERT-based classifier on a dataset of over 140,000 regulated poems, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art generative models such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek R1. Unlike general-purpose conversational models, the custom classifier offers unique insights into how poetic meaning may be encoded geometrically. The analysis shows that parallel lines exhibit striking symmetry in the model’s attention patterns: the ‘key’ vectors of corresponding characters align in direction, while this symmetry disappears in non-parallel lines. This finding is interpreted through Peter Gärdenfors’s theory of cognitive semantics, which posits that humans make sense of the world by organizing experience into distinct conceptual regions. The authors argue that poetic parallelism serves as a bridge between these regions, revealing a deeper, geometric order that underlies language itself.
