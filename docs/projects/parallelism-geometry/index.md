This study employs artificial intelligence to develop a geometric interpretation of parallelism in classical Chinese poetry, moving beyond purely symbolic readings. To automatically detect parallelism in poetic verse, the authors train a BERT-based classifier on a dataset of over 140,000 regulated poems, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art generative models such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek R1. Unlike conversational models, the bespoke classifier opens a window into the geometric foundations of poetic meaning. The analysis reveals that parallelism manifests as a measurable symmetry in the model’s attention mechanism: when queried by the classifier, the two lines of a parallel verse produce nearly identical response patterns (the ‘key’ vectors of corresponding characters point in the same direction). This symmetry is absent from non-parallel couplets. This finding is then grounded in Peter Gärdenfors’s theory of cognitive semantics, which posits that humans make sense of the world by partitioning experience into distinct conceptual regions. The authors argue that poetic parallelism functions as a bridging mechanism that temporarily unites these disparate domains of meaning, revealing a deeper, geometric order that underlies language itself.
