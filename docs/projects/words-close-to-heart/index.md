# Words Close to Heart

## A Techno-Cognitive Approach to Interiority in Modern Chinese Literature

This article argues that Chinese fiction guides reader empathy by placing selected social and political realities in textual proximity to interiority metaphors (e.g., “heart,” “mind,” “stomach”). This privileged textual zone, which I term “heart-space,” is analyzed through a dual approach. First, a word embedding model trained on a large corpus of Chinese fiction tracks the diachronic shift of interiority metaphors across several historical periods, from the early Ming Dynasty to the twenty-first century. As the concept of interiority migrates from one epoch to the next, its vector moves closer to some words and farther from others in the embedding space, highlighting the most urgent preoccupations of each epoch. Second, a close reading of Ye Xin’s novel *Wasted Years* 蹉跎歲月 (1980), a representative work of Scar Literature, demonstrates how an unequal distribution of “heart-space” invites the reader to identify with certain protagonists at the expense of others. By linking computational models of semantic proximity to the poetics of narrative attention, the article argues that the distribution of “heart-space” is a key cognitive mechanism that shapes readerly engagement in Chinese fiction.
