    <p>My name is Maciej Kurzynski (馬傑 / 马杰), and I am a Postdoctoral Fellow (Research Assistant Professor) at the Advanced Institute for Global Chinese Studies, Lingnan University, Hong Kong.</p>

    <p>Originally from Wrocław, Poland, I have received my PhD from Stanford University in modern Chinese literature and culture. Prior to that, I had also studied at the University of Warsaw (BA), Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne (Erasmus), and Zhejiang University (MA).</p>

    <p>I am the single author of this website, but my dream is to develop it into a collaborative endeavor in the near future (i.e., I hope that there will be a list of faces here rather than just mine). I call this virtual space a "lab" even now, since I think of this project as a series of experiments rather than attempts to confirm what we already know about Chinese culture and history.</p>

    <p>Quantitative humanities (<strong>qh</strong>) is all about experiments: using digital tools and statistical methods to probe literary and cultural phenomena. The goal of <strong>qh</strong> is not to solve problems but to explore new ways of thinking about texts and how they interact with us, humans. This website showcases some of my endeavors in this direction.</p>

    <p>You can contact me at maciej.kurzynski[at]ln.edu.hk.</p>
