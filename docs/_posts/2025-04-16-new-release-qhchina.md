The new website is finally out. It is fully github-based, which will make it easier to maintain and significantly cheaper as well. It will still take me some time to tweak a few things and bring back the content from the previous version.

## Package available on PyPI 

The package is slowly coming into shape. While a lot of functionality is still in early alpha version, you can install the package already now using pip:

```python
pip install qhchina
```

Check out our [documentation](/pkg_docs/) for detailed guides on getting started with qhchina. More updates and new features coming soon!
