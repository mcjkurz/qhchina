We are excited to announce the launch of the qhChina Lab website! This site will serve as a central hub for our research on quantitative approaches to Chinese humanities.

## About qhChina Lab

qhChina Lab is dedicated to developing computational tools and methodologies for humanities research focused on Chinese language texts. Our interdisciplinary approach combines:

- Natural Language Processing
