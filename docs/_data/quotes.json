      "text": "The idea which I have never ceased to develop is that in the end one is always responsible for what is made of one. Even if one can do nothing else besides assume this responsibility. For I believe that a man can always make something out of what is made of him. This is the limit I would today accord to freedom: the small movement which makes of a totally conditioned social being someone who does not render back completely what his conditioning has given him.",

      "translation": "In the past, when a family gathered, they spent most of the time chatting casually. That's not the case anymore. Now, whenever they come together, it's to debate the issues of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Between fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives—even kids in their teens and elderly grandmothers—everyone joins the debate.",

      "translation": "The battle of proper names follows the arrival of the foreigner and one will not be surprised by it.

Since I had always been especially sorry for people who suffered from fearful dreams or deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man. Suddenly I drew back the hand which was ready to shake him, frightened at the thing I was about to do. At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about to recall him.",

She's not the embodied Linda; she's mostly made up, with a new identity and a new name, like the man who never was. Her real name doesn't matter. She was nine years old. I loved her and then she died. And yet right here, in the spell of memory and imagination, I can still see her as if through ice, as if I'm gazing into some other world, a place where there are no brain tumors and no funeral homes, where there are no bodies at all. I can see Kiowa, too, and Ted Lavender and Curt Lemon, and sometimes I can even see Timmy skating with Linda under the yellow floodlights. I'm young and happy. I'll never die. I'm skimming across the surface of my own history, moving fast, riding the melt beneath the blades, doing loops and spins, and when I take a high leap into the dark and come down thirty years later, I realize it is as Tim trying to save Timmy's life with a story.",

Yet, she was not as spinelessly pathetic as the others, who had gone limp with fear. A woman, she nevertheless remained seated perfectly upright, motionless. Xiaolou gave her a reassuring gesture, a silent \"don't be afraid.\" A complex tangle of emotions played across her eyes. Though the aftershocks of fear still lingered, the sight of him—and his telling her not to be afraid—allowed her heart to finally settle.",
