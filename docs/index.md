## What is qh?

"Quantitative Humanities" is a set of scholarly disciplines which can be characterized by the following keywords:

- **Experimentation**: probing literary and visual texts with digital tools and statistical methods
- **Text-centrism**: considering literary artifacts as more than mere anecdotes reflecting extra-textual forces and ideologies
- **Quantification**: reinterpreting narrative phenomena as vectors, frequencies, distances, and networks
- **Big Data & Small Data**: reading large corpora, single novels, and tiny paragraphs
- **Multidisciplinarity**: combining natural language processing with cognitive neuroscience and traditional humanistic methodologies: close reading, genealogy, structuralism, aesthetic theory, narratology, etc.
- **Limits of computation**: identifying what stories can tell us about the world and ourselves that matrix multiplications cannot

## What is China?

How to write about "China" (中國) without being "obsessed" (情迷) by it? How to think about the present moment without invoking "modernity"? Events that defined national histories and academic fields, however significant from one perspective, might appear from another like storms in a teacup.

This project pursues disciplinary misalignments as sites where the limitations of identity-based scholarship come into view. Dominant chronologies, in fact any chronology, persist only so long as the comfort of native intimacies and familiar answers remains unchallenged.

The future to come awaits always in the form of monstrosity.
