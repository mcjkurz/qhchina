## What is qh?

"Quantitative Humanities" is a set of scholarly disciplines which can be characterized by the following keywords:

- **Experimentation**: probing literary and visual texts with digital tools and statistical methods
- **Text-centrism**: considering literary artifacts as more than mere anecdotes reflecting extra-textual forces and ideologies
- **Quantification**: reinterpreting narrative phenomena as vectors, frequencies, distances, and networks
- **Big Data & Small Data**: reading large corpora, single novels, and tiny paragraphs
- **Multidisciplinarity**: combining natural language processing with cognitive neuroscience and traditional humanistic methodologies: close reading, genealogy, structuralism, aesthetic theory, etc.
- **Limits of computation**: identifying what stories can tell us about the world and ourselves that matrix multiplications cannot
