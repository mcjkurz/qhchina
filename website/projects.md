# Projects

At QHChina Lab, we are engaged in several research projects focused on computational analysis of Chinese texts. Here are some of our key initiatives:

## Current Projects

### qhchina Python Package

The qhchina package is our flagship computational toolkit designed specifically for Chinese humanities research. It includes modules for:

- Word embeddings for classical and modern Chinese
- Topic modeling with Chinese-specific preprocessing
- BERT-based text classification for Chinese documents
- Collocation analysis for Chinese texts
- Specialized corpus management for Chinese texts

[Learn more in our documentation](/docs/)

### Additional Projects

*More projects will be added soon*
